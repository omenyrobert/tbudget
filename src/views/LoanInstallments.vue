    <h3>FAQs</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>o create an effective FAQ page, answer these questions.

1. What keywords are customers looking for?

Use your analytics dashboard to see how people find your site in searches. If you’re starting a new business, you can research keyword phrases in Google Keyword Planner and Soovle.

2. What’s on my competitor’s FAQ page?

See what Q&As they include and which keywords they focus on, but remember that they may not have optimized their FAQ page. Use keyword analysis tools (see above) to decide if they’re on the right track.

If so, you may want to include similar (but not too similar) content. If not, don’t follow their lead.

3. Are your questions phrased the way customers will write or ask them?

Try typing your questions in your browser’s search bar to get a sense of how people key in those questions. Then ask your questions on your mobile device or digital assistant to hear what sounds natural. Next, write your natural-sounding questions and answers in short, clear sentences that will look good on a mobile or desktop screen.

Now, read them out loud. If they sound weird or confusing, rewrite them until you can imagine Siri reading them.

4. Is your FAQ page formatted properly?

Group your FAQs by category if you have more than one type of question in categories like shipping, services, products, or something else. Use your carefully researched keywords in the page’s meta tags. Include relevant links to the products or services mentioned in your FAQ.

Add contact info so people who didn’t find the answer they wanted can ask your directly, and wrap up the FAQ with a call to action like “shop now,” “book now,” or “contact us.”</p>
